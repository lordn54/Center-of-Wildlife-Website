<h1>Wildlife Hazard Assessment</h1>
<p>
A description of FAA's <a href="wildlife_hazard_assessments_and_management_plans.pdf">Wildlife Hazard Assessments and Wildlife Management Plans at Part 139 and GA Airports</a>.  This document discusses the regulations, data collection, education, and research topics.</p>  

<p>We have compiled a template that airports can use when creating their Wildlife Hazard Assessment plans.  Click here to download a copy of the Microsoft Word document....</p>
