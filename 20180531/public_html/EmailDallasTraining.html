<h2 color="#35587A">Airport Wildlife Hazard Management Workshop</h2>
<p>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University<br>
Dallas, TX (DFW)<br>
July 31, 2013 - August 2, 2013</p>
<p>

Since 2006, Embry-Riddle Worldwide has offered Airport Wildlife Hazard Management Workshops at a variety of locations throughout the year.

The program consists of discussions on wildlife population management and dispersal techniques,
Endangered Species Act compliance, strike reporting, wetlands mitigation, pesticides usage, drafting and implementation of integrated wildlife hazard management programs, and an overview of applicable local, state and federal laws, regulations and ordinances.

As with all Professional Education courses at Embry-Riddle Worldwide, Wildlife Hazard Management Workshops are open enrollment and do not require application to the University. Just register, pay and start learning.
Each three-day workshop consists of:
<ul>
<li>Two days of interactive classroom sessions</li>
<li>Material taught by four of the nation's premier airport wildlife experts</li>
<li>A hands-on field trip to the host airport where classroom theory is directly observed</li>
</ul>
<br>
The workshop is acceptable to the FAA Administrator for compliance with the airport wildlife hazard training requirements of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 139 and FAA Advisory Circular 150/5200-36. This training is required for biologists who wish to write airport wildlife assessments or for persons who wish to conduct airport wildlife recurrent training sessions. It is also an excellent training program for those working in airports in wildlife mitigation. Our students have come from all over the U.S. as well as Africa, Europe and South America.
